                    <h1>About Us & Our Mission</h1>
                    <p>With PitchGuru you save time, money and stress with your presentations.

                        Not only start-ups need presentations. Wherever employees need to be informed and partners and customers need to be won, there is a presentation. 50 percent of all companies in Germany regularly use presentations to convince customers in sales, win partners or initiate internal projects. Employees spend an average of 20 hours per month creating these presentations. But: designing convincing, attractively designed slides is not that easy. We know that from our own experience.
                                        </p>    
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-lg-12">
                  <h1>How everything started</h1>
                  <p>At the beginning of 2018, our founders were working on a pitch deck for a new business idea. All the data had been collected and the content written - all that was missing was a professional design that brought all the information together in a clear and appealing way. Both lacked the time and creativity for this.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But the search for a professional service provider turned out to be more difficult than expected. Agencies cost several thousand euros and sometimes had long lead times for new projects. Freelancers were cheaper and more flexible. The only question was whether the freelancer would deliver the work on time and with the right quality.
                   
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When our founders finally failed with their old business idea, they remembered: there must be an easier way to get professional slides quickly and cheaply!
                    
                  </p>
                   <p>
                    The idea for PitchGuru was born: a platform with curated designers where you can get individually and professionally designed presentation slides at the best conditions and where ordering is as easy as you are used to from e-commerce. Our founders started recruiting a number of freelancers until we launched our first website and a handful of designers in early 2019. Since then we have been supporting start-ups, management consultancies, investment banks and large corporations with professional presentation slides on a daily basis.
                   
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The specific focus on slides and lean processes allows us to professionally design presentations quickly and cheaply, saving our customers time, money and human resources.
